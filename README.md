TerrainSimulator
================

Terrain Simulator is a tool for generating terrains using and mixing different algorithms, like
Perlin Noise and Voronoi Cells. It also contains some terrain editing capabilities and thermal erosion support.
A experimental, but very buggy feature is water erosion simulation.

I built this project a few years ago for an examination during highschool-graduation, it is no longer maintained.
