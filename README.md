Terrain Simulator is a tool for generating terrains using and mixing different algorithms, like
Perlin Noise and Voronoi Cells. It also contains some terrain editing capabilities and thermal erosion support.
A experimental, but very buggy feature is water erosion simulation.

Building the project requires wxWidgets and freeglut, building might be a bit painful, as the project hasn't been maintained for a few years now.
